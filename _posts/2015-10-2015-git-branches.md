As I was going over some of the work I was doing for my internship last week, I learned (or quite possibly re-learned!) that when you create a new branch, <em>where</em> you check out your branch <em>from</em> matters. 

Fortunately, the nature of the work I was doing on these branches were an easy fix for the CEO of the company (who is also a senior developer). He also explained that this is one of the most common mistakes for developers.

As a junior developer new to this working environment, this is something I will be keenly aware of as I move forward. I expect when I am working on projects where I have a more significant role, this will be an error I would be wise to avoid.
