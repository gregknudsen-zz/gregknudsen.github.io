It's good to be back. It's been almost 7 months since my last post. I've decided I'm going to think of that fact differently than I normally do - which is to get frustrated. Frustrated that I don't have the time to devote to coding (or blogging!)...frustrated/fearful that this career transition will NEVER happen. I mean, it's been over 3 years since I decided to make the switch and almost 2 years since I travelled to New York for Dev Bootcamp. I'm embarrased at this point when people (of the few whom I've told about this) ask me if I'm still doing the 'computer thing'. Sheepishly, I say 'yup' and quickly try to change the subject. It's never going to happen, right?*

Wrong. It <em>will</em> happen. Or, at least that's how I have to think. I also have to be realistic and know my limitations. I write this while my wife is watching some tv with two (of three) of our kids before bedtime. It would be nice to be there with them, but this is a good time to do some work before I get too tired. 

### This Summer
---

I had originally wanted to send my wife and those two kids up to PA for the summer, so I could really focus on finding a job. That will no longer be the case because both of our boys will be going to summer school. This is a good thing for them, as it will give them both a much needed routine (they are both special needs FYI). In theory, the thought of being here in FL with only one boy sounded like a good idea. Sure, I would probably have gotten 15-20% more work/study done. There were, however, a few problems I don't think I could fully reconcile. 

> First, there was no way I could tell my wife that her going up north would have guaranteed me a job by the end of summer. If I knew for sure that would be the case, I think we both have been ok with it. Believe me, I'm still going to work my ass off this summer, but there's just no guarntee that I will find something.

> Second, I would miss the two kids more than I think - quite possibly to a point where it would have hindered my ability to work. Last summer, my wife went up north for a month with the two kids for the same reason - to work hard to get a job. <i>I got a lot of stuff done (like [Brunzies](www.brunzies.com)), and I learned a lot as an intern for a local company. I just couldn't find a job.</i> But the kids are older now (obviously!), and they are just too much fun. I believe I underestimated the toll that would have taken on me.

So, here I am - back again. I've been starting to code a little more since the holidays, but it's time to step it up and start learning!
