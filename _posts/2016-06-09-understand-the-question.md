I was having a conversation with my son, Benjamin, recently. As I was giving him some pretzels close to bedtime, he kept on asking for more - more than usual. Our conversation went something like this: 

> Benjamin: Daddy, I want more pretzels!

> Me: Ok, Ben, but why do you think you're so hungry? 

> Benjamin: Because I want them.

> Me: I know you want them, but why do you think you're so hungry?

> Benjamin: Because you've got pretzels!

> Me: Yes, I do have them right here, and I'll give you more, but **why** do you think you're so hungry?

> Benjamin: Because I want the pretzels.

> Me: (Surrendering) Ok, Ben, here you go. And the reason why you're so hungry is because you didn't eat enough dinner.

The question I posed to him was straight forward, and there was a reletively clear answer. However, as you can read from his responses, Benjamin clearly didn't understand the question being presented to him. It was almost as though he was answering a different question. 

So here's the deal. Benjamin is 4. He's not an age where he can quickly correlate the cause and effect relationship of 'not eating enough dinner' to 'I'm really hungry right now, and I want more preztels!'
