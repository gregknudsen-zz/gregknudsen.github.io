I was having a conversation with my son, Benjamin, recently. As I was giving him some pretzels close to bedtime, he kept on asking for more - more than usual. Our conversation went something like this: 

> Benjamin: Daddy, I want more pretzels!

> Me: Ok, Ben, but why do you think you're so hungry? 

> Benjamin: Because I want them.

> Me: I know you want them, but why do you think you're so hungry?

> Benjamin: Because you've got pretzels!

> Me: Yes, I do have them right here, and I'll give you more, but **why** do you think you're so hungry?

> Benjamin: Because I want the pretzels.

> Me: (Surrendering) Ok, Ben, here you go. And the reason why you're so hungry is because you didn't eat enough dinner.

The question I posed to him was straight forward, and there was a reletively clear answer. However, as you can read from his responses, Benjamin clearly didn't understand the question being presented to him. It was as though he was answering a different question. 

So here's the deal. Benjamin is 4. He's incredibly intelligent, but he's not at an age where he can quickly correlate the cause and effect relationship of 'not eating enough dinner' to 2 hourse later thinking, 'I'm really hungry right now, and I want more preztels!'

I had an online interview last week with a company called [Launchcode](https://www.launchcode.org/). It was composed of four parts, which they, thankfully, shared with me in an email the day before. The first was a 'get to know you' conversation followed by asking me about my past experience - tech and non tech. Those two parts were fairly interconnected and went well. The third part, though not always needed, was to be a little coding exercise. A part of the process to get to the interview portion for Launchcode was a coding challenge consisting of 3 problems in 90 minutes using [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)(which is a **very** cool site, btw). Depending on how an applicant did on that coding challenge determined if the coding challenge during the interview was necessary. I wouldn't say I bombed the 90 minute challenge, but I did not solve any of the problems. Therefore, I knew this would be part of my interview.

We got to that part of the interview, and he gave me a link to a simple editor using screenshare
