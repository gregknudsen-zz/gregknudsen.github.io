I was having a conversation with my son, Benjamin, recently. As I was giving him some pretzels close to bedtime, he kept on asking for more - more than usual. Our conversation went something like this: 

> Benjamin: Daddy, I want more pretzels!

> Me: Ok, Ben, but why do you think you're so hungry? 

> Benjamin: Because I want them.

> Me: I know you want them, but why do you think you're so hungry?

> Benjamin: Because you've got pretzels!

> Me: Yes, I do have them right here, and I'll give you more, but why do you think you're so hungry?

> Benjamin: Because I want the pretzels.

> Me: (Surrendering) Ok, Ben, here you go. And the reason why you're so hungry is because you didn't eat enough dinner.

Benjamin clearly didn't understand the question I was presenting to him.
