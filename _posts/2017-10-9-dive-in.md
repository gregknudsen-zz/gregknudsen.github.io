I'm not sure it's sunk in yet, but that doesn't really matter. I got a job - a dev job. My days with the [Sarasota Orchestra](https://www.sarasotaorchestra.org), at least as a full time member, are over. This is a journey I started about four years ago this month. There were/are many reasons I decided to make this change, but that belongs in its own blog post. 

How it happened was somewhat what I expected. *Where* it happened was definitely a surprise. The fact that I'm able to stay in Sarasota was not really on my radar. I was thinking New York, DC, Austin would be the place. In early July 2017, I was looking through my email, as I did multiple times daily, and saw 'Javascript Developer, Sarasota, FL'. I didn't read anything after that before I hit apply. As I told my friends, it wouldn't have mattered if the position was for a Senior Javascript Architect - I was going to apply.

After two phone interviews, two in-house interviews (all of which I felt pretty good about), I was offered a three week trial. That then turned into an offer of full employment. 

And, of course, in the middle of almost 100% of this process was [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com). My second bootcamp in three years (along with the soon to be defunct [Dev Bootcamp](https://www.devbootcamp.com)), Lambda School is focused on front end development with React as well as full stack Node development - exactly what I want to do. And I was *extremely* grateful they allowed me to shift into the evening only part time course. 

It's been strange going to a job knowing that I have SO MUCH to learn, but one of the most important skills I have learned is to be comfortable being uncomfotable.

More to come...
