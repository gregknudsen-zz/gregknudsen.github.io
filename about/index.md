I am a professional [musician](http://www.sarasotaorchestra.org/our-musicians/trumpet/greg-knudsen?referer=trombinoscope){:target="_blank"}, [developer](http://www.github.com/gregknudsen){:target="_blank"}, and artist living in Sarasota, FL. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.<br><br>
I'm a family man, <span id="former">former</span> scratch golfer, lover of all (well, most) things [Apple](http://www.apple.com){:target="_blank"}.<br><br>
When I code, I like to put on the headphones and listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N8sUccRiTA).<br><br>
I'm not sure what the future holds, but I am excited to see what happens and continue learning.<br><br>
I'm currently seeking a junior web developer position. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:dev.artist15@gmail.com) or by visiting my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/gregory-knudsen/41/b33/64){:target="_blank"} profile. Thanks for visiting!
