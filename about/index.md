I am a professional [musician](http://www.sarasotaorchestra.org/our-musicians/trumpet/greg-knudsen?referer=trombinoscope){:target="_blank"}, [developer](http://www.github.com/gregknudsen){:target="_blank"}, and artist. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.
I'm not sure what the future holds, but I am excited to see what happens and continue learning.
I'm currently seeking a junior web developer position. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via email or by visiting my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/gregory-knudsen/41/b33/64){:target="_blank"} profile. Thanks for visiting!
