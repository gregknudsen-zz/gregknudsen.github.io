> > I'm currently a software developer for Duquesene Light Company in Pittsburgh, PA. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:dev.artist15@gmail.com) or by visiting my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/gregory-knudsen/41/b33/64){:target="_blank"} and/or [Github](https://github.com/gregknudsen){:target="_blank"} profile. Thanks for visiting!

I am a former professional [musician](http://www.sarasotaorchestra.org/our-musicians/trumpet/greg-knudsen?referer=trombinoscope){:target="_blank"}, working [developer](http://www.github.com/gregknudsen){:target="_blank"}, and artist living in Indiana, PA. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.<br><br>
I'm a [family man](http://imgur.com/BAKjeyD){:target="_blank"}, <span id="former">former</span> scratch golfer, lover of all (well, most) things [Apple](http://www.apple.com){:target="_blank"}. I'm a [Walking Dead](http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead){:target="_blank"}, [Game of Thrones](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones){:target="_blank"}, and [Leftovers](http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers){:target="_blank"} fanatic.<br><br>
I attended [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/locations/new-york/){:target="_blank"} - a truly amazing experience. While I learned a lot about various technologies at DBC (Ruby, JS), the most valuable skill I acquired was 'learning how to learn'. This skill has been invaluable to me over the past several months as a professional developer.
I also recently graduated from [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com) - a three month, intensive web development program with a focus on front end technologies such as NodeJS and React.<br><br>
