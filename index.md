> I'm currently seeking a junior/intern web developer position. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:dev.artist15@gmail.com) or by visiting my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/gregory-knudsen/41/b33/64){:target="_blank"} profile. Thanks for visiting!

I am a professional [musician](http://www.sarasotaorchestra.org/our-musicians/trumpet/greg-knudsen?referer=trombinoscope){:target="_blank"}, [developer](http://www.github.com/gregknudsen){:target="_blank"}, and artist living in Sarasota, FL. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.<br><br>
I'm a [family man](http://imgur.com/BAKjeyD){:target="_blank"}, <span id="former">former</span> scratch golfer, lover of all (well, most) things [Apple](http://www.apple.com){:target="_blank"}. I'm a [Walking Dead](http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead){:target="_blank"}, [Game of Thrones](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones){:target="_blank"}, and [The Leftovers](http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers){:target="_blank"} fanatic.<br><br>
I attended [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/locations/new-york/){:target="_blank"} - a truly amazing experience. As a profesional trumpet player, teaching young trumpet players has always been one of my favorite things to do. Eventually, I would love to be in a position to teach people to code, as I know what a struggle it can be. 
In addition to teaching, I'm always very excited to learn new technologies. I'm in the process of learning Angular.js and plan on moving to React.js afterwards.<br><br>
I'm not sure what the future holds, but I am excited to see what happens and continue learning.<br><br>
