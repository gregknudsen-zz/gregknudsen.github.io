# Here are my projects!

###[Brunzies](http://www.brunzies.com){:target="_blank"}{:class="project-link"}

>This is a website for a bar located in Indiana, PA. For the website, I used HTML, CSS, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap for layout. I also used git for source control. There are many todo's I have for this site like adding more photos for the gallery as well as implementing Ajax.
