# Here are my projects!



>###[Brunzies](http://www.brunzies.com){:target="_blank"}{:class="project-link"}
>This is a website for a bar located in Indiana, PA. I used HTML, CSS, jQuery and Twitter 
Bootstrap for layout. I also used git for source control. There are many todo's I have 
for this site like adding more photos for the gallery as well as implementing Ajax.
Another thing I would say about this website is that, if I had it to do over again, 
I would do just about everything differently. How that would primarily manifest itself 
would be implementing a build structure. Right now, all of the html pages have the same 
header/footer code, and this was always a pain/waste of time to make any changes (DRY much?). 
Clearly, I need to break that code into partials or templates to apply to each page. 
As this is my first website created/deployed, I went with what was comfortable for me, 
and I would think that's fairly common for junior developers. What I have come to realize 
is that while it may have taken me a bit more time to learn how to implement a build 
structure, in the long run, it would save much more time. With a few projects in the works, 
I will definitely remember this.
